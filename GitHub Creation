🧭 GitHub Learning Manual (Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners)
📘 Part 1: Understanding the Basics
What is Git & GitHub?

Git → A version control system that tracks changes in your code.

GitHub → A website/platform that hosts Git repositories online and helps people collaborate on projects.

Think of Git as your tool, and GitHub as your online storage + teamwork hub.

🧰 Part 2: Setting Up
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

Go to https://github.com

Click Sign up

Choose a username, email, and password

Verify your email to activate the account

✅ Done! You now have a GitHub account.

Step 2: Install Git

Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads

Download for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Follow installation steps with default options

Open your terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash)

Run:

git --version


→ You should see something like git version 2.xx.x

Step 3: Configure Git

In your terminal, set your name and email:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"


This info shows up when you make commits.

📁 Part 3: Creating Your First Repository
Step 1: Create a Repo on GitHub

Log in to GitHub

Click the + icon (top-right) → New repository

Give it a name (e.g., my-first-repo)

Choose Public or Private

Optionally check “Add a README file”

Click Create repository

✅ You’ve created your first GitHub repo!

Step 2: Clone the Repo to Your Computer

Copy the repository’s HTTPS URL (it looks like this):

https://github.com/your-username/my-first-repo.git


Then in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-repo.git


Now, you have a local copy of the repository!

To go inside it:

cd my-first-repo

💻 Part 4: Working with Files
Step 1: Create or Edit Files

You can create a file, e.g.:

echo "Hello GitHub!" > hello.txt


Or open the folder in your code editor (like VS Code) and edit files.

Step 2: Check Changes

To see what changed:

git status

Step 3: Add and Commit Changes

Add your file to Git:

git add hello.txt


(You can add all files with git add .)

Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Add hello.txt"

Step 4: Push to GitHub

Send your changes online:

git push


Go back to your GitHub page — you’ll see your file there! 🎉

🔄 Part 5: Updating Your Work

If someone else made changes (or you edited on GitHub), get the newest version:

git pull

🌿 Part 6: Using Branches

Branches let you work on new features safely.

Create a Branch
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature

Make Changes, Commit, and Push
git add .
git commit -m "Work on new feature"
git push --set-upstream origin new-feature

Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your repo on GitHub

You’ll see a Compare & pull request button

Add a message and click Create pull request

After review, you (or a teammate) can click Merge to bring the branch into main.

🧹 Part 7: Keeping Things Clean

After merging a branch, you can delete it:

git branch -d new-feature


And on GitHub, click Delete branch for the remote one.

🤝 Part 8: Collaborating with Others
Fork a Repository

If you want to contribute to someone else’s project:

Go to their repo

Click Fork (creates your copy)

Clone your fork and make changes

Create a Pull Request to suggest changes

🎯 Part 10: Practice Project Ideas

Try these to build muscle memory:

Create a “Notes” repo and upload daily learning logs.

Work with a friend — make branches and pull requests.

Try resolving a merge conflict (intentionally edit the same file in two branches).
